### pktd

`pktd` is the reference full node [_PKT Cash_](https://pkt.cash/)
implementation, written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

`pktd` is the primary mainnet node software for the PKT blockchain. It is known
to correctly download, validate, and serve the blockchain, using rules for block
acceptance based primarily on Bitcoin Core, with the addition of
[PacketCrypt proofs](https://pkt.cash/PacketCrypt-2020-09-04.pdf) to provide
verification of the unique _bandwidth-hard_ proof-of-work algorithm.

The PKT blockchain provides for a
[Network Steward](https://pkt.cash/network-steward/), chosen by consensus, who
receives a portion of the PKT mined from each block. The role of the Network
Steward is to support the PKT blockchain and ecosystem, fighting for enhanced
privacy and greater individual autonomy for all. Anyone holding PKT Cash is
eligible to cast a vote to choose the Network Steward. The Network Steward's
treasury account does not accumulate indefinitely - it _"burns"_ any balance
older than 129,600 blocks (~3 months), which encourages the Steward to use their
PKT holdings to provide support and funding for
[worthy projects](https://github.com/pkt-cash/ns-projects).

The `pktd` software is under active development - releases should be considered
_beta_ quality software. The unreleased code in the `develop` branch is highly
experimental and of _alpha_ quality - it has not yet been rigorously tested, and
should **not** be used in production environments.

It is recommended that users run the most recent tagged release (or a checkout
of the `master` branch) for production deployments.

The `pktd` full-node software utilizies peer-to-peer networking to relay newly
mined blocks, as well as individual transactions not yet included in a block. It
also maintains a local transaction pool, consisting of transactions that have
been accepted, based on rules defined by network consensus. Transactions undergo
strict checking and filtering based on miner-defined requirements, separating
them into two classes: _"standard"_ and _"non-standard"_, allowing them to be
processed accordingly.

Unlike most cryptocurrency software, `pktd` does _NOT_ provide any "built-in"
wallet capability. This intentional design decision was made to enhance overall
security and software modularity. While this means you cannot make or receive
payments using `pktd` directly; this functionality is provided by the bundled,
but separate, [pktwallet](https://github.com/pkt-cash/pktd/pktwallet/) package.
Additional alternative wallet packages are currently under active development.

### Requirements

- [Go](http://golang.org/) (_Golang_), release **1.14.1** or later, running on a
  supported **64-bit** platform.
- A somewhat recent release of Git (_used to clone the repository, and by Go to
  download dependencies_).

---

### Building pktd

- Using `git`, clone the project from the repository:
  - `git clone -b develop-johnsonjh https://github.com/johnsonjh/pktd`
- Then, use the `do` script to build `pktd`, `pktwallet`, and `pktctl`:
  - `cd pktd && ./do`

_Optionally_, run extended tests and generate code coverage reports:

- Using `go get`, install the `gocov` and `gocov-html` tools into your `GOPATH`:
  - `GO111MODULES=off go get -t -u github.com/axw/gocov/gocov`
  - `GO111MODULES=off go get -t -u github.com/matm/gocov-html`
- Then, run the coverage generation script: (_zsh, bash, ksh, or mksh
  required_.)
  - `PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/bin:${PATH} ./cov_report.sh`

### Linux Distributions

It is _highly_ recommended to use the official Go toolchain distributed by
Google, available for download from the [Go homepage](https://golang.org/dl).

Software built and packaged for Linux distributions is often compiled with
different defaults and non-standard patches, often deviating significantly from
the corresponding official upstream release. This usually done to meet
distribution-specific policies and requirements, but presents a unique hazard
for software software such as `pktd`, operating on distributed consensus. This
class of software is unique, in that it must maintain _bug-for-bug_
compatibility in consensus-critical codepaths. Nodes which incorporate their own
changes, even well-intentioned _"fixes"_, may not be able to properly
interoperate on the main network, and, in sufficient numbers, these nodes could,
unintentionally, create an isolated or '_forked_' blockchain, usable only by
other similarly broken nodes.

While not _currently_ the source of any _known_ issue,
[Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=ON_QA&component=golang)
will backport cherry-picked updates from unreleased versions (or produce their
own patches) to fix specific issues in their releases. They are also known to
currently ship a Go distribution with a much different linker configuration than
the upstream. [Debian](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/golang-defaults) is well
known for making changes to upstream sources, often extensively, sometimes
[incorrectly](https://www.zdnet.com/article/debian-and-ubuntu-openssl-generates-useless-crypto-keys/).

For these reasons, support can only be provided for Linux when the software is
compiled from unmodified source code, using the official toolchain. If you have
any doubts about your installed Go software, Google provides an automated
[Go installer for Linux](https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/getgo/installer_linux).

### Documentation

Currently, documentation for `pktd`, `pktwallet`, and `pktctl` is a
"work-in-progress".

**GoDoc** documentation is provided, but is mostly developer-focused at this
time. It can be viewed by running `godoc -http=:6543` in the directory
containing the `pktd` source code tree, then loading
[http://localhost:6543/pkg/github.com/johnsonjh/pktd/](http://localhost:6543/pkg/github.com/gridfinity/pktd/)
in a web browser.

The same **GoDoc** documentation is also available at
[pkg.go.dev/github.com/johnsonjh/pktd](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/johnsonjh/pktd),
which does not require a local copy of the source code, or the `godoc` tool
installed.

There is also documentation in the
[docs](https://github.com/johnsonjh/pktd/tree/develop/docs) directory of the
source tree available for review.

### Community

- [PKT.chat](https://pkt.chat) is a
  [Matterfoss](https://github.com/cjdelisle/Matterfoss) server providing
  real-time interaction for the PKT community.
- Other options are available and listed on the
  [PKT.cash](https://pkt.cash/community/) web site.
